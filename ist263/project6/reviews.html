                <h2>As Above So Below</h2>
                <p>As Above So Below is a horror film written and directed by John Erick Dowdle. Told through a found film
                perspective, it follows the lead Scarlett, a scholar following in her father's footsteps of finding the
                philosopher’s stone. Her search leads her to the catacombs of Paris, where she is led by a guide that
                knows the way around the forbidden sections of the catacombs. As they descend deeper into the tombs,
                madness begins to occur. Inspired by Dante’s Inferno and the nine circles of hell, it explores the
                characters' different sins and traumas, and the found film style helps immerse you into the journey.
                While it's not the greatest objective film and has some rough parts, I thought the concept was very
                interesting and have watched it so many times with friends, and would recommend it to anyone looking
                for a more “fun” horror movie.</p>

                <h2>The Silence of the Lambs</h2>
                <p>The Silence of the Lambs is a psychological horror film written by Ted Tally and directed by Jonathan
                Demme. Adapted from Thomas Harris’s novel, it follows an FBI agent Clarice, who is on the hunt for
                Buffalo Bill. On her search, she gets help from Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a genius cannibalistic serial killer who
                has long been imprisoned. The casting of this movie is absolutely perfect and helps express the
                complexities of the interactions and conversations between the lead and Hannibal perfectly. It was an
                extremely interesting concept to see someone who is depicted as barbaric and inhumane be so
                intelligent and able to possess control of the conversations he’s in so well, and throughout the movie I
                even felt persuaded by him at times. This adaptation is one of the best I’ve ever seen and in my opinion
                perfectly encapsulates the novel's feel.</p>

            <h2>Grown Ups</h2>
                <p>Grown Ups is a comedy movie directed by Dennis Dugan, written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf. This
                movie follows a ragtag group of friends-turned-dads, and is a hilarious film to watch when you’re just
                looking to unwind. Adam Sandler is one of my favorite actors and the fact he got to basically play
                himself as a character, he just fits perfectly into the role. The entire cast is filled with comedy gems and
                it reminds me a lot of my personal friend group, which helps push it into my all-time favorites.</p>

                <h2>One Piece</h2>
                <p>One Piece is a cartoon and novel series written by Eiichiro Oda, that follows Luffy and his crew on his
                journey to becoming King of the Pirates. Seemingly lighthearted, it explores themes of freedom, unity,
                and oppression through a tyrannical world government. Over 1000 episodes and counting, it’s
                impossible to explain this story and its significance. While this show is a bit more personal to me as I’ve
                grown up with it since I was a kid, it's genuinely one of the greatest fiction works I’ve ever read and
                watched. The worldbuilding and character development is absolutely perfect, rivaling Tolkien’s works in
                my opinion, and I would recommend this show to anyone looking for something to watch.</p>
